# Hauptstimme: Score design choices

Please see [this list of score stylistic design criteria](./score_design.md)

- Minimal deviations from MuseScore defaults
- Most systematic changes as defined in the `.mss` style sheet.
  - Justify full page
  - All present instrument showing at all time (none hidden).
    - Note, this applies _except for_ in some extreme cases such as Beethoven 9:
      - Movement 2: the ATB trombones rest for 500 bars
      - Movement 4: trombones, solo voices, chorus, and percussion.
    - Naturally hidden from display can easily be adapted by the user and does not affect the retrieval.
    - Note that "all present instruments" refers to the _movement_ (i.e., "tacet" from the movement = absent from the score)
  - Note: Import the `.mss` style file in-app or with the command line:
    - `mscore <before_file_name>.mscz --style <style-file-name>.mss -o <after_file_name>.mscz`.
- Every part on a separate stave (e.g., Flute 1 separate from Flute 2) for clarity and interoperability.
  - Note that this is a unique feature of this corpus, making it much more usable for both part extraction and MIR tasks.  
  - This is achieved partly through the `orchestra_part_split` functionality.
  - Connect bar lines through those like instruments e.g., Flutes 1 and 2; Horns 1, 2, and 3.
- Parts and part names:
  - Full part names in the format `<transposition where relevant> <instrument> <number>`, e.g., `A Clarinet 2`.
  - Abbreviated names without transposition or period character, e.g., `Cl 2`.
    - This deviates from common practice, but (for what it's worth) that musical practice is often wrong.
      - Periods should stand for incomplete works without the final letter, so then:
        - `Cl.` for `Clarinet` is fine
        - but `Vln` for `Violin` is not.
  - String instruments in the singular e.g., `Violin 1` (as in 'the violin 1 part')
    - Transpositions as in the original except no mid-movement transpositions.
      - For example the Beethoven symphonies do this in the horn parts (4/ii, 5/iii 4 bars before the end), and clarinets 9/iv.
      - This does not convert reliably, and adding a new part creates its own problems.
- Stave size. Manually set for each work to:
  - attempt approximate consistency across multi-movement works
  - use the largest stave size that fits within the page, including the large lyric annotations. 
    - ... within reason. As MuseScore does not allow variable stave size per page, we accept the occasional overflow to make the majority of pages plausible.
  - Again, if anyone uses these scores in performance, they may wish to adjust. 
  - More formally:
    - Strong preference for not overfilling page. 
    - Medium preference for avoiding under-fill. 
    - Medium preference for same number of staves on each page and weak preference that this include the last page.
- Copy the named (public domain) source edition exactly except in limited cases like:
  - some variation in "crescendo" vs "cresc." vs "hairpin" etc.
  - some written out repeats. For instance, we follow Eulenberg editions of Beethoven except when there are complex repeats liable to fail when exported (e.g., 4/iii, 9/ii).
  - stave and page breaks mostly follow MuseScore defaults.
    - Given the stylistic choices above, we make no attempt for page breaks to follow the source
      - E.g., using Eulenberg for the Beethoven means a very different page size.
    - notable exceptions include Brahms 4/iv which is in a completely regular 8-bar phrasing
      - we set this out with page breaks every 4 or 8 bars depending on the note density.
    - Tempo markings:
      - Tempos etc. exactly as in the source and properly encoded in MuseScore (mostly successful in conversion)
        - Tempo text (e.g., `Allegro`) is only ever included if present in the original source.
        - Tempo in metronome mark is:
          - ... included if present in the original source 
          - ... included in square brackets where clarification is needed (e.g., `tempo 1` is often not enough)
      - Here as elsewhere, avoid any "hidden" markings.
- Non-tempo textual markings
  - Haupstimme annotations usually as lyrics, as described in [this explanation doc](./annotation.md).
  - `Stave text` for instrument-specific markings like `arco`.
    - Note that original scores use annotations like `a2` where there are two parts on one stave.
      - We have split those parts so don't striclty need them
      - All the same, we include them where it might plausibly help clarify solos and the moves to/from unison.
  - `System text` for non-tempo comments that apply to all parts e.g., in Beethoven 9/ii, `ritmo de ...` and `[Written out reprise]`.
- Bar (Measure) counting. 
  - This is a perennially complex issue, and one often broken by export change of format.
  - Please see [our recent paper about this topic with a proposed solution here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3625135.3625136). 
  - For now, on MuseScore files we leave the default measure count (1, 2, 3, ...):
    - MuseScore offers some functionality to 'exclude bars from the measure count'
      - This can lead to improved layout in the app,
      - But experimentation shows that it does not convert well.
      - We therefore avoid such _manual_ changes and (attempt) to fix them automatically from the measure map.
    - Example issues: anacruses, first/second time bars, split bars.
    - This includes continuing the count in written out repeats (which again do not export well)
      - In future iterations of this corpus, when da capo structures can be reliably exported, we may delete these duplicate bars.
